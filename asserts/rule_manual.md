---

### D. Battle

Battles proceed according to the following flowchart:

> ⚠️ Neither player can attack on their first turn.

```
① Attack Declaration → ② Block Step → ③ Counter Step → ④ Damage Step → ⑤ End of the Battle
```

#### ① Attack Declaration

- Leaders or Characters in the Character area can attack.
- **Rest** the active Leader or Character you want to attack with and declare your attack.
- Choose the target of your attack:
  - Your opponent's **Leader**, OR
  - A **rested Character** in their Character area.
- Any **[When Attacking]** effects or effects that activate when your Leader or Character attacks are activated at this point.

#### ② Block Step

The player being attacked can activate the **[Blocker]** effect of one of their Characters.

#### ③ Counter Step

The player being attacked may perform the following actions in **any order** and **as many times** as they like:

- **Activate a Character card's [Counter] effect**: Trash a Character card with a Counter value to activate an effect that increases the power of your Leader or one of your Characters by the Counter value for the duration of the battle.
- **Play an Event card**: Trash an Event card with a **[Counter]** effect from your hand to activate the effect.

#### ④ Damage Step

Compare the power of the attacking and defending cards.

**If the attacking card's power is greater than or equal to the defending card's power** (attacker wins):

- **When the opponent's Leader is attacked**: The Leader takes 1 damage.
  - **When the opponent's Leader has 0 Life**: The attacking player **wins the game**.

##### Damage to Leaders

When your Leader takes damage, check the contents of the card at the top of your Life cards without showing your opponent.

- If that card has a **[Trigger]** effect, you may reveal the card and activate its Trigger effect instead of adding it to your hand.
- You can also choose **not** to activate the Trigger effect. In this case, add the card to your hand without revealing it.
- If your Leader takes 2 or more damage due to an effect (such as **[Double Attack]**), the above process is repeated for every 1 damage taken.

#### ⑤ End of the Battle

The battle ends.

- If there are any effects that activate at the end of the battle, they can be activated at this point.
- All effects specified as applying during this battle are **canceled**.

## Miscellaneous

### Effect Activation Order

- A player whose card has multiple effects that occur at the same time can decide in which order to activate these effects (e.g., a Character with multiple **[When Attacking]** effects).
- If you and your opponent both have effects that occur at the same time, **the player whose turn it is activates their effects first**. After all of their effects have been resolved, the other player will activate their effects.

### Multicolored Cards

A single card may have more than one color in this game. Cards with multiple colors are treated as having **all of the specified colors simultaneously**.

### When a Character with DON!! Card(s) Leaves the Field

When a Character that has been given DON!! card(s) leaves the field (e.g., due to being K.O.'d or returned to a player's hand by an effect), the attached DON!! card(s) should be **returned to the cost area and rested**.
